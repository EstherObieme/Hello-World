# Hello-World
This is my first repository launching my career as an IT Data Analyst. Starting off with GitHub tutorial, to learn more about repositories, branches, commits, pull requests, etc. 

<h3>About MySelf</h3>
<p>My name is Esther Obieme. I am an African Nova Scotian student, studying IT Database Administration at Nova Scotia Community College. I am currently in my second year, and Iâ€™m looking forward to graduating, officially kicking off my career in the IT Data industry. 
Looking back to where I started from and comparing it to my current status, the journey to gain the required knowledge, leading to a career in the IT Data Industry, I can confidently claim that I have come a long way. I was originally inspired by the evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to dive into the Information Technology world.  I have always been mesmerized by technology in general, specifically computers, ideally smart phones. Computer where exceptionally a wonder to me, how it makes our daily lives seem effortless and the whole world, a global village. It felt like I could achieve anything just by owning one, which is being proven true every day, by social media, apps, application, technological development.</p>

<p>I remember my last year in high school, </p>
